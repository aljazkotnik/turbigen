# turbogen

The turbogen library is a tool for generating three-dimensional axial turbine
geometries based on a set of input aerodynamic parameters.

## Features

## Basic usage
 
```python

   >>>

```

## Tests to write

* target reaction is achieved
* no negative or invalid values for geometry output over a range of angles
* verify polytropic effy is correct 
* verify a few hand-calculated repeating-stage velocity triangles


## TODO

* Make sure all routines are commented
* List out the tests to be written
* Set up skeleton documentation
* Write up the reaction solution
* Make station numbering consistent (abc, in/out, 123)
* Remove superflous stuff from NonDimStage class
